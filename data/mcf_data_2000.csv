You are able to communicate the impact of those ideas and formulate plans to implement them  Communicating clearly and logically – Your communication style is laser clear, succinct, and professional  You are data-informed – You are able to dive into data to identify opportunities and then measure your impact. You prioritise the value you can add to customers, and can get the entire company behind you by telling stories with data.  You are curious and actively reflect – None of us have a perfect skillset, but you’re continuously conscious of what you’d like to learn next and curious enough to follow through  You have work experience in China for a product focused company  You are fluent in MandarinSome extra skills that would be great (but not essential):  Prior experience in banking, payments, finance, or a related field  You are fluent in CantoneseWe’re people without borders — without judgement or prejudice, too. We want to work with the best people, no matter their background. So if you’re passionate about learning new things and keen to join our mission, you’ll fit right in.Also, qualifications aren’t that important to us. If you’ve got great experience, and you’re great at articulating your thinking, we’d like to hear from you.And because we believe that diverse teams build better products, we’d especially love to hear from you if you’re from an under-represented demographic."

a73dae6b7ad5d6ab93dbb191758fa2ba," Senior Associate, Product Designer, Middle Office Technology, Finance Design Team, Group Design (WD29434)","The Product Designers we really want to hire deliver real value to real users. In other words, they design stuff that gets built. If you are passionate about bringing simplicity to complex information systems — we have a challenge for you.What you'll be doingYou'll spend most of your time trying to simplify very complex products and ideas in order to reduce employee pain points - by looking into processes, policies, procedures and systems that support planning and operation of the bank.It may be an uphill battle, but it's worth it. If you succeed, your designs will enable thousands of people to serve millions of our customers better. We say that, if you can work in a bank, you can work anywhere.Don't worry if you don't have the relevant finance/domain knowledge, it's something you will pick up along the way, just be sure you're eager to learn and be immersed in the fintech world. Besides, we're a nice bunch of people. Around here, we go out of our way to help one another.Here's what your week might look like  You'll spend time with our wonderful research team. Together you'll try to understand the business goals of your project and, more often than not, meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement.  Once you know where you're going, it's time to tackle the behemoth tech systems and legal restrictions of a bank. Your product manager will become your best friend. You'll message the tech lead more than your parents. You'll get a crash course in finance law.  We do respect the privacy of people with headphones-on, trying to avoid eye contact. So you'll have the time to actually produce work you're proud of.  We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognise when a better argument or solution is put before them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you.  Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it doesn't get built. We love you, Dribble/Behance. It's not you, it's us. You will meet stakeholders from different departments and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an honorary Toastmaster.  To prepare for those meetings you'll need to check the latest relevant data.  Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner, drinks or Creative Day (we do something fun and creative together once a month).Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have  You're an end-to-end designer: you can turn high-level requirements into well-posed problem statements, wireframes, prototypes or Powerpoints for the management teams.  You can talk confidently and clearly about design and build lasting relationships with our stakeholders.  And you're not afraid to improvise—to think on your feet—when required.  You can brainstorm the next big thing one moment and still tweak pixels right before launch.  You have the ability to prioritise (you don't focus on illustrations if the UX looks like a love child between Frankenstein and Krusty the Clown).  You work smart and are ready to improve processes.  You have enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends.  You have confidence in your ideas and the ability to communicate them clearly.  You follow through—when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements.Bonus points  You actively contribute to the UX community.  You're kind of a behavioural science geek.  You have personal pet projects you work on for fun in your free time.Your team and careerYou will be part of the DBS enterprise design team.The enterprise design team is redefining what great internal tools look like: working on a collaborative platform to enable bankers, credit risk managers and credit controllers to manage corporate loans digitally.Behind the scenes, the team understands how important it is for a proper design process and system to be in place before great things can happen._______________________________________________________________________________________________________________About DBSDBS is a leading financial services group in Asia.
