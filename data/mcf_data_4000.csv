e137510e1900028b4c08099d9c3e9ad0,Software Engineer,"As a Junior Software Engineer at Stripe you'll be helping increase the GDP of the internet. This has many hard and interesting challenges which require novel solutions. What is the best developer experience for making payments? How do you balance API versioning while keeping changes fast? How do you build an API generic enough for any marketplace while still being simple?Here are some past projects by your fellow new grads:  Analyzing how much of a negative balance each merchant should be able to hold. Too much and Stripe runs a risk of fraud, too little and it impacts merchant operations.  Bundling Tax and Shipping costs into a charge flow in a simple and intuitive manner.  Allowing merchants to give granular permissions to different users of their business. At a big company, the CFO shouldn't be making API calls nor should an engineer be accidentally actioning disputes.  Shipping Stripe to more countries and payment mechanisms (did you know there are  100 ways to pay in the world?)Engineering at StripeA core part of our engineering culture is inclusiveness: we want to accommodate people from all backgrounds and walks of life.We believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done.We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. (The first version of Stripe, for example, had a beta user since the time we could literally only charge a credit card—we couldn’t even pay out those charges!) This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want.We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.Our shipping culture How we recruit Guide to the onsite interview (PDF)Teams at StripeRather than adopting extreme models of ""horizontal"" teams oriented around technologies (a web team, a platform team, etc.) or ""vertical"" teams oriented around business goals (a revenue team), we pick and choose the parts we like about both models for our teams.Our ""vertical"" teams (Checkout, Ops, Product, and Risk) can operate independently, building the technology that they need to operate. Each one may not have deep expertise in every part of the stack, but they have enough that things can get done without blocking on other teams.Our ""horizontal"" teams (Data, Dev tools, Internal tools, Security, Sys) provide support to the others and have deeper expertise on particular parts of the stack. It's their job to build platforms that are so good the other teams want to use them, rather than being forced into it.Teams at Stripe are relatively fluid. Some people stay on a given team for a handful of months, while others seem to prefer sticking to their team permanently. Once you join, we'll work with you to choose a team to get started with—it's all pretty flexible.Stripe's engineering challengesYou should include these in your application:  Links to online profiles you use (GitHub, Twitter, etc).  A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose).If there are teams you'd be particularly interested in working on, please let us know (and tell us why!). This way we can have you interview with the people you'll likely work best with. This won't bind you to a specific team—we can figure that out together as the we learn more about your interests and strengths."
