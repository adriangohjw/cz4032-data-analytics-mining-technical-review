e2b2694df0fdd2577afedb371aa341e6,Senior Software Engineer - AI Platform,"Commercial Software Engineering (CSE) is a global engineering organization that works with Microsoft’s largest customers on cutting edge technologies. We code side-by-side with our customers' engineers to collaboratively innovate custom technology solutions tailored to solve their business challenges. Our work also involves the development of software assets that can be reused by other customers and these assets can contribute to the Microsoft platform. CSE is also an important source of customer feedback for Microsoft product groups and with every engagement, we aim to learn how to make our products better for our customers.As a Senior Software Engineer in CSE’s AI Platform Technology Domain (i.e. AI Platform subject matter expert team) within the Data  AI Solution Area, you will team up with other CSE engineers on customer engagements involving Microsoft’s AI offerings such as Azure ML, Cognitive Services, other related MS technologies such as Azure Cognitive Search and Video Indexer but also open source AI tooling. We understand that most technologies are evolving very quickly, so broad experience in the AI space and the ability to quickly upskill and unblock others is the key to success. By interacting with our customers’ engineering teams and Microsoft’s product engineering teams, you will develop real-world technical experience that helps customers grow their business and Microsoft to improve our products and services. Watch this video to learn more about who we are and what we do: https://aka.ms/csevideoWe welcome diversity of all kinds. CSE includes many cultures, educational backgrounds, life stages, identities and technical skills and we continue to build a culture where all voices and perspectives are heard and considered. If you have an open mindset and an inclusive working style, you may be just the engineer that we are looking for. If you love learning new things, enjoy challenges that often result in fast failure on the path to deeper understanding, then please throw your name into the hat!ResponsibilitiesThis is in no way a complete list of what you will be doing day-to-day, but it should give you a framework that this role operates within:  Participate in architecture design sessions and coding sprints working alongside CSE engineers and customer engineers to help them make good design decisions specifically around building good AI solutions, for example ML Ops. This is not a data scientist role - there is a data science team that will partner with you on these engagements.  Be a hands-on software engineer where needed, so you’ll need to be able to write good quality code. However, we mostly bring AI capability to the existing CSE industry engineering crew that has end-to-end ownership of the customer engagement, not adding extra capacity to work on any technology.  Collaborate with other members of the AI Platform Technology Domain and across other technology domains to strategically invest in building reusable assets that improve our ability to deliver quality solutions to customers  Identify deep insights from customer engagements and partner with the product group on using customer needs and insights to guide future product roadmap  Flexibility to travel when you believe it would be more efficient and effective to collocate with the customer or CSE engineering crew during architecture design sessions or for an important coding sprint, and occasional CSE-wide events to build relationships across the org (we comply with all local guidelines related to travel and worksite opening during the Covid-19 pandemic)QualificationsWe do not believe that any specific education level or major is a requirement to be successful in this role. We are open to all backgrounds and if have the skills to deliver, we’d be thrilled to have you.Ideally, you’ll have a number of these skills:  Familiarity with the Microsoft Azure cloud as well as technologies such as Azure ML or Microsoft’s Cognitive Services or Azure Cognitive Search or Video Indexer will be an advantage but similar experience with another cloud platform may also be extremely valuable  Experience in end-to-end ML implementation, including data pre-processing, feature engineering, tuning of ML models and finally applying DevOps principles to ML (i.e. ML Ops)  An ability to write good code in your favorite programming language (experience with Python may be helpful), and familiarity with common ML frameworks and tools  Experience working within geographically dispersed, diverse, and virtual teams  Proven experience providing technical leadership, drawing insights and able to communicate effectively with senior customers and product groupsIf you are interested in the role but not sure if it is right for you, please reach out. We want you to find a role that you love, where you can do your best work. If you’d like to learn more about our company values, I encourage you to read https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/values.#CSE-FY21Microsoft is an equal opportunity employer.

CSE is also an important source of customer feedback for Microsoft product groups and with every engagement, we aim to learn how to make our products better for our customers.As a Senior Software Engineer in CSE’s AI Platform Technology Domain (i.e. AI Platform subject matter expert team) within the Data  AI Solution Area, you will team up with other CSE engineers on customer engagements involving Microsoft’s AI offerings such as Azure ML, Cognitive Services, other related MS technologies such as Azure Cognitive Search and Video Indexer but also open source AI tooling. We understand that most technologies are evolving very quickly, so broad experience in the AI space and the ability to quickly upskill and unblock others is the key to success. By interacting with our customers’ engineering teams and Microsoft’s product engineering teams, you will develop real-world technical experience that helps customers grow their business and Microsoft to improve our products and services. Watch this video to learn more about who we are and what we do: https://aka.ms/csevideoWe welcome diversity of all kinds. CSE includes many cultures, educational backgrounds, life stages, identities and technical skills and we continue to build a culture where all voices and perspectives are heard and considered. If you have an open mindset and an inclusive working style, you may be just the engineer that we are looking for. If you love learning new things, enjoy challenges that often result in fast failure on the path to deeper understanding, then please throw your name into the hat!ResponsibilitiesThis is in no way a complete list of what you will be doing day-to-day, but it should give you a framework that this role operates within:  Participate in architecture design sessions and coding sprints working alongside CSE engineers and customer engineers to help them make good design decisions specifically around building good AI solutions, for example ML Ops. This is not a data scientist role - there is a data science team that will partner with you on these engagements.  Be a hands-on software engineer where needed, so you’ll need to be able to write good quality code. However, we mostly bring AI capability to the existing CSE industry engineering crew that has end-to-end ownership of the customer engagement, not adding extra capacity to work on any technology.  Collaborate with other members of the AI Platform Technology Domain and across other technology domains to strategically invest in building reusable assets that improve our ability to deliver quality solutions to customers  Identify deep insights from customer engagements and partner with the product group on using customer needs and insights to guide future product roadmap  Flexibility to travel when you believe it would be more efficient and effective to collocate with the customer or CSE engineering crew during architecture design sessions or for an important coding sprint, and occasional CSE-wide events to build relationships across the org (we comply with all local guidelines related to travel and worksite opening during the Covid-19 pandemic)QualificationsWe do not believe that any specific education level or major is a requirement to be successful in this role. We are open to all backgrounds and if have the skills to deliver, we’d be thrilled to have you.Ideally, you’ll have a number of these skills:  Familiarity with the Microsoft Azure cloud as well as technologies such as Azure ML or Microsoft’s Cognitive Services or Azure Cognitive Search or Video Indexer will be an advantage but similar experience with another cloud platform may also be extremely valuable  Experience in end-to-end ML implementation, including data pre-processing, feature engineering, tuning of ML models and finally applying DevOps principles to ML (i.e. ML Ops)  An ability to write good code in your favorite programming language (experience with Python may be helpful), and familiarity with common ML frameworks and tools  Experience working within geographically dispersed, diverse, and virtual teams  Proven experience providing technical leadership, drawing insights and able to communicate effectively with senior customers and product groupsIf you are interested in the role but not sure if it is right for you, please reach out. We want you to find a role that you love, where you can do your best work.

e137510e1900028b4c08099d9c3e9ad0,Software Engineer,"As a Junior Software Engineer at Stripe you'll be helping increase the GDP of the internet. This has many hard and interesting challenges which require novel solutions. What is the best developer experience for making payments? How do you balance API versioning while keeping changes fast? How do you build an API generic enough for any marketplace while still being simple?Here are some past projects by your fellow new grads:  Analyzing how much of a negative balance each merchant should be able to hold. Too much and Stripe runs a risk of fraud, too little and it impacts merchant operations.  Bundling Tax and Shipping costs into a charge flow in a simple and intuitive manner.  Allowing merchants to give granular permissions to different users of their business. At a big company, the CFO shouldn't be making API calls nor should an engineer be accidentally actioning disputes.  Shipping Stripe to more countries and payment mechanisms (did you know there are  100 ways to pay in the world?)Engineering at StripeA core part of our engineering culture is inclusiveness: we want to accommodate people from all backgrounds and walks of life.We believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done.We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. (The first version of Stripe, for example, had a beta user since the time we could literally only charge a credit card—we couldn’t even pay out those charges!) This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want.We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.Our shipping culture How we recruit Guide to the onsite interview (PDF)Teams at StripeRather than adopting extreme models of ""horizontal"" teams oriented around technologies (a web team, a platform team, etc.) or ""vertical"" teams oriented around business goals (a revenue team), we pick and choose the parts we like about both models for our teams.Our ""vertical"" teams (Checkout, Ops, Product, and Risk) can operate independently, building the technology that they need to operate. Each one may not have deep expertise in every part of the stack, but they have enough that things can get done without blocking on other teams.Our ""horizontal"" teams (Data, Dev tools, Internal tools, Security, Sys) provide support to the others and have deeper expertise on particular parts of the stack. It's their job to build platforms that are so good the other teams want to use them, rather than being forced into it.Teams at Stripe are relatively fluid. Some people stay on a given team for a handful of months, while others seem to prefer sticking to their team permanently. Once you join, we'll work with you to choose a team to get started with—it's all pretty flexible.Stripe's engineering challengesYou should include these in your application:  Links to online profiles you use (GitHub, Twitter, etc).  A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose).If there are teams you'd be particularly interested in working on, please let us know (and tell us why!). This way we can have you interview with the people you'll likely work best with. This won't bind you to a specific team—we can figure that out together as the we learn more about your interests and strengths."
